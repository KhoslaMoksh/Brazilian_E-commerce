Aimed at improving the Company's Performance
Based on the insights above, here are some actions that Olist could take to boost its revenue and profit.

1.**Increase advertising efforts**: Based on the data, it appears that certain product categories such as Health Beauty, Watches Gifts, and Bed Bath Table generate higher revenue for Olist. Focusing on promoting these categories through targeted marketing campaigns could increase sales and revenue.

2.**Offer incentives to repeat customers**: Repeat customers account for a significant portion (approximately 20%) of Olist's sales. Offering incentives such as discounts, loyalty programs, or exclusive access to new products could encourage customers to continue shopping with Olist and increase revenue.

3.**Improve seller ratings:** Customers tend to purchase products from sellers with higher ratings. Encouraging sellers with lower ratings to improve their ratings through customer service training, better product descriptions, and timely delivery could lead to increased sales and revenue.

4.**Expand payment options:** While credit cards are the most popular payment method, expanding payment options to include more payment methods, such as e-wallets, could attract more customers and increase sales.

5.**Improve product selection:** Based on the data, certain product categories generate higher revenue for Olist. Adding more selection of products within these categories and offering exclusive or hard-to-find items could attract more customers and increase revenue. For example; if Olist currently offers a limited selection of health and beauty products, expanding the selection to include exclusive or niche brands could help the company to stand out in the market and attract new customers who are looking for those specific products.

6.**Focus on reducing cancelled orders:** Canceled orders result in lost revenue and can damage customer trust. Implementing measures such as improved inventory management and better communication with customers could help reduce cancelled orders and increase revenue.
