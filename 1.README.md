Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.
The Olist sales dataset is a collection of anonymized data about orders placed on the Olist from September 2016 to September 2018. It contains a wide range of information about each order, including the order date, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller IDs, and customer reviews. The dataset also includes information about the sellers who list their products on Olist, as well as data on customer behaviour and demographics. The dataset is designed to help analysts and researchers better understand Brazil's e-commerce landscape and identify growth and optimization opportunities.

The document CompleteAnalysis gives the whole Python project in Jupyter Notebook format. Certain other files, like DataDictionary, ProblemStatements, ReadingCSVfiles, and ProposedSolutions are also included.

For the four main questions/Problem Statements, I created four different PDF files for easy viewing. All of them are stored under the Python project folder.
